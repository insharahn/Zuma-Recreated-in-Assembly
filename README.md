# Zuma-Recreated-in-Assembly
The iconic game Zuma recreated using Assembly Language (MASM615 and Irvine32.)

# About
This is a recreation of PopCap's Zuma made for my Computer Organization and Assembly Language course. It features a frog-like creature in the center of the screen and multicolored balls winding down a trail. The objective of the game is to shoot all of the balls before they reach the end of the trail.

# Compilation
Irvine must be installed and integrated for the game to run. Compile the source using MASM615 and run it.
